# üèÜ Innovative Divination Rewards

Divination Rewards:

Users who participate in divination will receive Project token rewards. The rewards are distributed in two stages:

1. Stage 1 - Instant Reward:

* 50% of the divination fee is used to purchase Project token from the DEX at the real-time market price.
* The purchased tokens are immediately available for the user to claim after the divination session.

2. Stage 2 - Dutch Auction Linear Release Reward:

* The remaining 50% of the divination fee is sent to the treasury.
* These funds are used in a Dutch auction mechanism, where Project token are withdrawn from the Fate AI Agents' wallets at an auction-determined price.
* The Dutch auction price is usually lower than the DEX market price, allowing users to acquire more Project token for the same cost compared to a direct market purchase.
* The acquired tokens are then distributed to the user through a 5-day linear airdrop, ensuring a steady and structured release of rewards over time.

With this two-stage reward system, users not only gain market insights but also receive Project token in a cost-effective and rewarding manner.
