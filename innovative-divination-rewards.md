# 🏆 Innovative Divination Rewards

Users who participate in divination will receive **Project Token** rewards, distributed in two stages:

🔹 **Stage 1 - Instant Reward**

* **50%** of the divination fee is used to purchase **Project Token** from the DEX at the real-time market price.
* The purchased tokens are immediately available for the user to **claim** after the divination session.

🔹 **Stage 2 - Dutch Auction Linear Release Reward**

* The remaining **50%** of the divination fee is sent to the **treasury**.
* These funds are used in a **Dutch auction mechanism**, where **Project Token** are withdrawn from the treasury at an auction-determined price.
* The **Dutch auction price is usually lower than the DEX market price,** allowing users to acquire **more Project Token** for the same cost.
* The acquired tokens are then distributed through a **5-day linear airdrop**, ensuring a structured and steady release over time.

With this **two-stage reward system**, users not only gain **market insights** but also receive **Project Token** in a **cost-effective and rewarding manner**. 🚀
