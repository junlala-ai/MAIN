**Project Token Overview**

The **Project token** is the foundation of the **JunLaLa ecosystem**, designed to reward users and support the sustainable growth of the platform. Its economic structure aims to establish a balanced dynamic supply and demand, ensuring long-term value. Here are the key details:



**Creative User-Driven Fair Launch**

We're excited to give our users and community the power to create JunLaLaâ€™s official token! Hereâ€™s how it works:

* **Two Token Tickers to Choose From**: two potential token tickers will be announced on JunLaLa's X account.
* **User-Driven Launch**: Users will be able to fairly create tokens under these two tickers on **pump.fun**.
* **Final Selection**: The final token ticker and contract address (CA) will be determined from the tokens created by users on pump.fun. The selection will be made in the near future.&#x20;



**Token ReDistribution**

Once the official ticker and contract address (CA) are finalized, JunLaLa will purchase a portion of the official token to serve as treasury funds, which will be securely locked in smart contract. These tokens will be exclusively used for divination user rewards, under the control of smart contract.&#x20;

The remaining official tokens will remain on the DEX, ensuring liquidity and market access.



**Reward Mechanism: Driving Continuous Token Demand**

* **Stage 1**: 50% of the divination fee is used to purchase tokens from the DEX at market prices, which are then distributed as rewards.
* **Stage 2**: The remaining 50% is transferred to the treasury, where it undergoes Dutch auction (Tokens price typically lower than DEX market price) and is converted into the second set of rewards for users. Token consumption in the treasury creates additional demand.



**Dynamic Supply and Demand**

The Project token operates on a dynamic **supply and demand model**:

* **Divination Fees:** When users pay for divination, the project buys tokens from the market to reward users, creating consistent demand.
* **Recycled Tokens:** The tokens rewarded to users are cycled back into the system, fueling further demand and contributing to price stability.



**Price Stability**

The **reward mechanisms** combined with **consistent buybacks from the DEX** create a **self-sustaining ecosystem**, where demand for Project token continually drives its value upward.

* The balance between the treasuryâ€™s supply and dynamic purchasing system reduces the risk of major price fluctuations typical in many crypto projects.
* Dutch Auction rewards ensure users acquire tokens at an advantageous rate, supporting the long-term value of the token.
