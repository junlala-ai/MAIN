# ðŸ’° Tokenomics

The Project token is the core of the JunLaLa ecosystem, designed to reward users and ensure the sustainable growth of the platform. The token's economics are built to create a dynamic supply and demand balance, supporting its value over time. Here are the key details:

1. **Token Distribution:**

* **80% for Fate AI Agents:** The majority of the Project token (80%) are allocated to the 80 Fate AI Agents. These agents are responsible for managing the token's destiny and ensuring users are rewarded based on their divination activities. The tokens are distributed as rewards to divination participants.
* **20% for Initial Market Supply:** 20% of the total token supply is made available for public trading on decentralized exchanges (DEX), ensuring liquidity and market access.

2. **Fair Launch:**

* The Project token is launched in a fair and transparent manner. There are no pre-mined tokens, no team reserves, and no "hidden" funds. This ensures that all users have equal access to tokens, and the market determines the price.

3. **Dynamic Supply and Demand:**

* The Project token operates on a dynamic supply and demand model. When users pay for divination, the project buys Project token from the market to reward the user, creating consistent demand for the token.
* The tokens rewarded to users are then cycled back into the system, further fueling demand and contributing to price stability.&#x20;

4. **Reward Mechanism:**

* Every time a user performs a divination, the system generates demand for Project token. Half of the divination fee is used to buy tokens from the DEX at market prices, which are then distributed as rewards to users.
* Additionally, Stage 2 rewards (the Dutch auction process) are another source of demand. By purchasing tokens at auction-determined prices, users are rewarded with Project token at prices often lower than the DEX market price, thus providing more tokens for the same cost.

5. **Price Stability:**

* The reward mechanisms, combined with the consistent buybacks from the DEX, create a self-sustaining ecosystem where demand for Project token continually drives its value upward.
* The tokenâ€™s reward and buyback system helps stabilize the price of Project token by creating an ongoing cycle of demand. The balance between the treasuryâ€™s supply and the dynamic purchasing system reduces the risk of major price fluctuations typical in many crypto projects.
* Dutch Auction rewards ensure that users are acquiring tokens at an advantageous rate, further supporting the long-term value of the token.
