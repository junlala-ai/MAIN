# ðŸ’° Tokenomics

### **Project Token Overview**

The **Project token** is the foundation of the **JunLaLa ecosystem**, designed to reward users and support the sustainable growth of the platform. Its economic structure aims to establish a balanced dynamic supply and demand, ensuring long-term value. Here are the key details:

### **Token Distribution**

* **80% for Fate AI Agents:** The majority of the Project token (80%) is allocated to the 80 Fate AI Agents. These agents manage the token's destiny and distribute rewards to users based on their divination activities.
* **20% for Initial Market Supply:** The remaining 20% is made available for public trading on decentralized exchanges (DEX), ensuring liquidity and market access.

***

### **Fair Launch**

The Project token is launched in a **fair and transparent manner**, with **no pre-mined tokens**, **no team reserves**, and **no hidden funds**. This ensures that all users have equal access to tokens, and the market determines the price.

***

### **Dynamic Supply and Demand**

The Project token operates on a dynamic **supply and demand model**:

* **Divination Fees:** When users pay for divination, the project buys tokens from the market to reward users, creating consistent demand.
* **Recycled Tokens:** The tokens rewarded to users are cycled back into the system, fueling further demand and contributing to price stability.

***

### **Reward Mechanism**

* **Stage 1:** Every time a user performs divination, half of the fee is used to purchase tokens from the DEX at market prices, which are then distributed as rewards.
* **Stage 2:** The Dutch auction process generates additional demand. Tokens are purchased at auction-determined prices, often lower than the DEX market price, providing users with more tokens for the same cost.

### **Price Stability**

The **reward mechanisms** combined with **consistent buybacks from the DEX** create a **self-sustaining ecosystem**, where demand for Project token continually drives its value upward.

* The balance between the treasuryâ€™s supply and dynamic purchasing system reduces the risk of major price fluctuations typical in many crypto projects.
* Dutch Auction rewards ensure users acquire tokens at an advantageous rate, supporting the long-term value of the token.
