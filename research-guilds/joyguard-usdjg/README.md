# JoyGuard ($JG)

**JoyGuard ($JG) tokens** represent JunLaLa Research Guilds' innovative research initiative focused on the prevention of depression. By tapping into JunLaLa’s detailed health and emotional data gathered from JunLaLa AIWatch and the JunLaLa App, JoyGuard aims to identify early signs of depression and develop preventive methods that promote long-term emotional well-being. The project is committed to enhancing mental health by providing solutions that protect and nurture the joy in people’s lives.

The **JoyGuard ($JG)** tokens are created to fuel and support this important research, incentivize early adopters, and reward users for their engagement in mental wellness. A portion of the tokens (20%) will be airdropped to JunLaLa AIWatch holders to further grow the project's community. Additionally, a part of the raised funds (5-10%) will be allocated to the broader JunLaLa BIO Ecosystem, helping extend the impact of this research into other areas of health and well-being.
