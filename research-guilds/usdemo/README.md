# $emo

**$emo** tokens are a key component of JunLaLa Research Guilds' pioneering Anti-Depression research initiative. By leveraging JunLaLa's comprehensive emotional and health data collected via JunLaLa AIWatch and the JunLaLa App, $emo is committed to identifying early signs of depression and developing preventive strategies to promote emotional resilience. The projectâ€™s mission is to empower individuals with tools to shield themselves from emotional distress, transforming mental health care from reactive to proactive, helping users lead emotionally balanced lives.

The **$emo** tokens are created to support this groundbreaking research, incentivize early adoption, and reward active participation in promoting emotional well-being. A portion of the tokens (20%) will be airdropped to JunLaLa AIWatch holders to foster the growth of a vibrant, engaged community. Further more, a portion (5-10%) of $emo tokens will be donated to BIO Ecosystem, to support the development of the DeSci world.
