# Node Types and Upgrade Mechanisms

* **General Computing Power Nodes:** Sold in a blind box format, with 10,000 units in the first batch. Users can upgrade their nodes to increase computing power and mining efficiency, with nodes reaching a maximum level of 30. Each upgrade requires $LALA. General nodes have certain consumption attributes, and users need to maintain and upgrade their nodes to ensure optimal output.
* **Premium Genesis Nodes (AI Watch):** AI Watch is JUNLALAâ€™s premium Genesis computing power node, offering superior performance without the need for upgrades. AI Watch has higher computing power, providing users with stable and higher mining efficiency, and allows mining before $LALA is listed, enabling users to mine in advance.
