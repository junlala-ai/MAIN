# Mining Reward Mechanism

1. **Cyclical Halving:** Mining rewards halve every 90 days, with the entire token distribution cycle spanning four years to ensure long-term stable token release.
2. **Dynamic Allocation Mechanism:** If the total computing power exceeds the $LALA available for distribution in any given hour, rewards per unit of computing power will be dynamically adjusted to ensure fair distribution.
3. **Minimum Withdrawal Requirement:** Users need to accumulate at least 2,000 $LALA to withdraw their rewards, ensuring liquidity and providing instant trading opportunities.
